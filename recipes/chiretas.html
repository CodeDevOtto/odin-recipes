    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chiretas is a traditional dish from the Spanish Pyrenees, particularly in Arag√≥n. It consists of lamb stomach stuffed with a mixture of rice, diced offal (lung, heart, and liver), bacon, and spices. The stuffed stomach is then sewn shut and boiled until firm. Similar to haggis but without blood, chiretas can be eaten hot or cold and are sometimes fried for extra crispiness. They are often served with bread and red wine.</p>
